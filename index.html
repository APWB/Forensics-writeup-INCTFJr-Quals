So, I played <a href="https://app.traboda.com/contest/inctf-jr-21-quals"> Inctf jr qualifiers </a> this winter...was a fun filled contest...It was also my first CTF..XD
Got qualified for the finals though
Posting writeups of some of the forensics challs I solved....
</p>
Forensics challs were really easy..well for me
<h3> Chall name : Dark Wave </h3>
<h4>Category:hard
</h4>
<h5>Description:Can you visualize sound?</h5>
<p>
So we were provided with a audio file
Now, this chall's category was given as hard..but looked the easiest to me
The solve was really simple.
<br>
The description told can u visualise sound?
<br>
So my first guess was Audacity
I opened the audio file given in audacity and opened the sound in spectogram format..and there it's. 
The flag was there only...

<h3> Chall name:Tweak Me </h3>
<h4> Category: Medium</h4>
<h5> Description :Tweak the Image width by width until it shows what you want it to show! </h5>
<p>
Once again an easy chall..a simple one 
<br>
I just opened the image file provided to us in a hex editor..made the width 1600 and it gave me the flag
</p>

<h3> Chall name: Finding Data </h3>
<h4> Category : Medium </h3>
<h5> Description : Sometimes, we see only what we want to see. Look deeper... </h5>
<p>
While reading the description..one word hit me hard
<br>
The word was <strong>deeper</strong>
<br>
My first guess was to use binwalk tool..And it turned out that a zip file was embedded in the image.
I extracted it...Now it needed password
<br>
So I used exiftool and found the password 
<br>
Used it and got the flag
</p>

<h3> Chall name : Corrupt </h3>
<h4> Category: Medium </h4>
<h5> Description : Do you believe in 'magic'? </h5>
<p>
So we were provided with a zip file
Now this word, <strong>magic</strong> striked me...<i>Magic Numbers</i>
So, I opened the file in a hex editor..as predicted the file header was wrong
<br>
Corrected it and got the flag
